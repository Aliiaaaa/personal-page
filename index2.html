        <p>My name is Aliia. I am a student who is interested in learning web design and exploring creative projects. I enjoy trying new things, meeting new people, and working on ideas that can grow into something meaningful. In my free time, I love dancing, drawing, and sewing. I enjoy expressing myself creatively and experimenting with new ideas. I would describe my character as thoughtful and curious. I like observing the world around me and thinking carefully before making decisions. I am also open to learning from new experiences and enjoy helping others whenever I can.</p>
